# bamazon Customer View  


### Hi there in this app we have to create something "similar" to amazon , our own version - bamazon- here are the steps to accomplish our homework mission !! 


##### Create a MySQL Database called bamazon.

##### Then create a Table inside of that database called products.

The products table have the following  columns:

* item_id (unique id for each product)

* product_name (Name of product)

* department_name

* price (cost to customer)

* stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)

 ### Here is  an example of how this will look on the terminal/bash  :

id  | product | department |   price   | Quantity

1   |  boots  |  shoes     |    150    | 350

 Check out this video for a great demo of our bamazon app !

#### Our next step is to  create a Node application called bamazonCustomer.js. Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.

The app should then prompt users with two questions.

* The first  ask for the  ID of the product they would like to buy.

* The second message ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

 Once the customer has placed the order, your application should check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

If not, the app will log a phrase like -Insufficient quantity!- and then prevent the order from going through.
If you do have enough go ahead and log the screen with the total amount to pay.


This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.
Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.

 
 ### Remember to be able to use the code shown here we need to install all the correct npm node packages ! 
 
 
 Mainly we use my sql -package- and -require- but we are going to need a couple more as we move forward with part 2 and 3 of the homework assigment.
 
 #####    Well guys I believe this is all for now , check back with me for a great update of this homework on a very near future !! 
  ####  like always thanks for visiting and hope you find this readme  clear and fun just like our brand spanking new app BAMAZON !
